==============================================
(II) Test 3: Expected Behaviour:
  1. Instruction Address increment by 0x8 for each iteration
  2. Writes 0x0FF1CECAFEBADF00D every iteration
  3. Writes only high 4 bytes
  4. At the same time, Data Address increment by 0x8 for each iteration
  5. The two ports should give identical outputs
