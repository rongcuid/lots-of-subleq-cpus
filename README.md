# lots-of-subleq-cpus
This repo will contain lots of SUBLEQ toy cpus implemented by me.

# Bugs
Yes, there *will* be bugs. For example, the `02-accumulator` in Pipelined version seems to give out wrong results (after I concluded the challenge). I will not fix them, as these are mainly challenges to help build up knowledge for my megaproject. So, these are essentially *toys*.
